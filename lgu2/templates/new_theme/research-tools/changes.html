        <h2>What changes will I be able to explore with this changes to legislation search?</h2>
        <h3>Changes made by primary legislation</h3>
        <p>You can see details of the changes made by all primary legislation enacted since 2002. Changes made by primary legislation before 2002 are not available here; they have been incorporated into the content of the primary legislation.</p>
        <h3>Changes made by secondary legislation</h3>
        <p>You can see details of the changes made by all secondary legislation enacted since 1971.</p>
        <h3>Changes to Legislation originating from the EU</h3>
        <p>You can see details of the changes to EU Regulations and Decisions originating from the EU that have been made by UK legislation. Changes to EU legislation made by EU legislation were captured from EUR-Lex up until the UK left the EU, at 11.00 p.m. on 31 December 2020, and you can see those here too.</p>
        <h3>How soon changes are made available</h3>
        <p>Changes made by new legislation are available here as soon as possible after the legislation is received by our editorial team. In most cases the changes will be available within two weeks of the new legislation being published, though during particularly busy periods for new legislation it may take us longer to process them.</p>
